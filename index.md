# Emely Rendon's Portfolio 

I am a Computer Science major at California State University Fullerton. I plan on graduating CSUF in the year 2028.


## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1, Part 1
    I found our first lab of the semester very enjoyable. Since it was the first lab, it felt amazing
getting to learn how to use GitHub and learning to clone a repository. I also found it very interesting
and fun using all the git commands such as git clone, git status, git add, git commit, and git push. 
Making our own personal token was also very important. After submitting the cloned repository, 
I felt that this was a great way to start the labs for this semester with paired partners as well. 

Lab 5, Part 2
    For Lab 5, I found this Lab to be my favorite one of the semester. Not only because I had scored 
all my 30 points and finished the lab on time, but because the lab used if statements. I also really
enjoyed this lab because I was able to learn how to convert from int to double. I think I found this
lab enjoyable because me and my partner also did half the work and were equally distributed with lines
of code we had to finish. Overall, I felt that this lab strengthened my ability of writing if statements,
converting from integers to double, and still getting comfortable with using GitHub and its commands. 

Lab 6, Part 1
    For Lab 6, I would like to say that it was a decent lab for me. Though I only scored a 22/30 I would
say it was a good challenging code. Though I really enjoyed Part 1 particularly because I was using
what I learned in my Lecture class about vectors and continuing using if statements. Though I did have 
trouble at first using command line arguments, I had gotten the hang of it by challenging myself with this lab.
Overall I thought this lab was very well for practicing out of my comfort zone.
